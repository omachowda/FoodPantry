# Food Pantry

## Introduction
This report gives an overview of Wesley and Parkland Food Pantry visitor trends over previous years. We utilized data from the Wesley Food Pantry starting in 2012, and the Parkland Food Pantry starting in 2014. We also combined the 2 data sets to see how they compared to each other in recent years. We created a total of 5 graphs to provide an overview of the trends we noticed during our initial analysis. We also ran some statistical tests to determine the significance of the trends we visualized.

#Conclusion
Though our statistical tests were inconclusive, our graphs gave us a lot of insight into the data. Because we were able to visualize these trends, we can make some predictions about the future.

1. Parkland food pantry will likely overtake Wesley food pantry in size sometime in the next year
2. Months with Major holidays like Novemeber and December will continue to be busy each year
3. We can loosely predict the number of individuals that will come to the food pantry in a given month using the regression model.
